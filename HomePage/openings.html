            I am looking for motivated research students in the year of 2024 interested in machine learning and optimization, especially in the field of reliable machine learning. I am currently interested in the following topics:
            <ul>
              <li>Robustness against adaptive and general adversarial perturbation with applications in auto-driving.</li></br>
              <li>Effective and efficient algorithms to train deep neural networks with guarantees in differentiable privacy.</li></br>
              <li>Optimization and generalization properties of deep learning.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Applicants should have a bachelor degree in computer science, mathematics or related majors, with a GPA higher than 85 / 100 or 3.3 / 4.0 (80 / 100, 3.0 / 4.0 for a few top universities). Other requirements upon application are listed on the <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/pg/research-degree-programmes/entrance-requirements" target="_blank">university's website</a>.</p>

            <p>If you are interested in working with me, apply directly by sending me an email with your CV and your undergraduate transcript.</p>

            <p>For successful Ph.D. applicants, the studentship rate is arond 18k HKD per month. You can check <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/pg/research-degree-programmes/scholarships-financial-aid-and-fees" target="_blank">this webpage</a> for more information about the financial aid provided by the university. Outstanding candidates are eligible to apply for <a href="https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html" target="_blank">Hong Kong Ph.D Fellowship Scheme</a>, in which a higher rate of scholarship (~27.6k HKD per month) will be provided.</p>

            <p>City University of Hong Kong also have joint Ph.D. programmes with other universities. The entrance requirements are generally the same as regular Ph.D. students. More information is available on <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/pia/page.aspx?p=PhD_Joint_Degree_Programmes" target="_blank">this website</a>.</p>

            <p>Research students can be enrolled in January, June and September each year. </p>
