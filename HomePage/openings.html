            <h3>Ph.D / MPhil</h3>

            I am looking for motivated research students in the year of 2024 interested in machine learning and optimization, especially in the field of reliable machine learning. I am currently interested in the following topics:
            <ul>
              <li>Robustness against adaptive and general adversarial perturbation with applications in auto-driving.</li></br>
              <li>Effective and efficient algorithms to train deep neural networks with guarantees in differentiable privacy.</li></br>
              <li>Optimization and generalization properties of deep learning.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Applicants should have a bachelor degree in computer science, mathematics or related majors, with a GPA higher than 85 / 100 or 3.3 / 4.0 (80 / 100, 3.0 / 4.0 for a few top universities). Other information and requirements upon application are listed on the <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/pg/research-degree-programmes/entrance-requirements" target="_blank">university's website</a> and the <a href="https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/academic-programmes/master-philosophy-doctor-philosophy/admissions" target="_blank">department's website</a>.</p>

            <p>If you are interested in working with me, please apply directly by sending me an email with your CV and your undergraduate transcript.</p>

            <p>For successful Ph.D. applicants, the studentship rate is around 18k HKD per month. You can check <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/pg/research-degree-programmes/scholarships-financial-aid-and-fees" target="_blank">this webpage</a> for more information about the financial aid provided by the university. Outstanding candidates are eligible to apply for <a href="https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html" target="_blank">Hong Kong Ph.D Fellowship Scheme</a>, in which a higher rate of scholarship (~27.6k HKD per month) will be provided.</p>

            <p>City University of Hong Kong also has joint Ph.D. programmes with other universities. The entrance requirements are generally the same as regular Ph.D. students. More information is available on <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/pia/page.aspx?p=PhD_Joint_Degree_Programmes" target="_blank">this website</a>.</p>

            <p>Most MPhil positions are offered on a self-funded basis.</p>

            <p>Research students can be enrolled in January, June and September each year. The anticipated duration is 4 years for Ph.D. programme and 2 years for MPhil programme.</p>

            <h3>Short-term Research Opportunities</h3>

            <p>I welcome highly motivated CityU undergraduate students to conduct research with me. Applicants should have a strong background in mathematics and programming. If you are interested in my research area, feel free to reach out via email. Along with your CV and transcripts, please tell me the brief idea of your interested research direction in your email.</p>

            <p>For senior CityU undergraduate students looking for final year project (FYP), please first check <a href="https://fyp.cs.cityu.edu.hk:443/" target="_blank">FYPMS</a> for more information. If you have a research idea related to my research interest, you can also directly send me an email about it.</p>

            <p>If you are an external student seeking a research assistant position, please feel free to reach out to me via email. Kindly attach your CV, undergraduate transcripts, and any relevant research works you may have. For short-term research applications, evaluation will primarily consider the alignment of the proposed research topic with our ongoing projects.</p>
